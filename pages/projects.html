          This image is of the final product in a project from CISC 480: AI and
          Robotics. We used a Lego Mindstorm robot and a python program to
          control the robot to draw various letters. For final test, we were
          able to have the robot draw simple words like "mile". It was a very
          fun project to work on!

          This image is from my final project in STAT 400: Data Mining and
          Machine Learning. It is a visualiztion of a neural network model we
          found when trying to predict stock prices. We used five companies,
          Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple and the data from the last
          5 years of their opening and closing prices. Although our model only
          had a 57% rate to predict the right price, I was still able to learn a
          lot about machine learning and neural networks.

          This image is from my final project in STAT 360: Comp STAT and Analysis.  It is our path diagram from our final project where we analyzed a dataset of car
          accidents and tried to find common factors that led up to more deadly crashes.  Some of our findings were that drivers being under the influence of drugs or alchohol,
          driving during the night and dangerous road conditions from weather or road damage leads to more fatal accidents.
